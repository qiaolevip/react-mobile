# React Mobile

This react mobile provides a prepared development environment based on [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp), [stylus](https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus) and [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack).

####[Demo](http://qiaolevip.github.io/react-mobile)
This mobile does not include some fancy UI stuff but is a lightweight starting point for your next react app.

## Get the kit

```
$ git clone https://github.com/qiaolevip/react-mobile.git && cd react-mobile
```

## Installation

Install all dependencies. 

```
$ npm install
```


## Development

Builds the application and starts a webserver with livereload. By default the webserver starts at port 1337.
You can define a port with `$ gulp --port 3333`.

```
$ npm start
```

Running different app

```
$ gulp --app family
```

## Build

Builds a minified version of the application in the dist folder.

```
$ gulp build --type production

$ gulp build --type production --app family
```

## Testing

We use [jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/) to test our application.<br />
You can run the tests that are defined under [app/scripts/\_\_tests__](./app/scripts/__tests__) with

```
$ npm test

```

## Javascript

Javascript entry file: `app/scripts/main.js` <br />

**ES6 with babel**

We are working with the webpack [babel loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader) in order to load our .js/.jsx files. Babel allows you to use ES6 features like class, arrow functions and [much more](https://babeljs.io/docs/compare/).



## CSS

CSS entry file: `app/stylus/main.styl`<br />

**Stylus**

As you can see we are using stylus to preprocess our .styl files. If you didn't work with a css preprocessor before the [stylus page](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) is a good starting point to get to know what stylus can do for you.<br /><br />
If you want to use third-party CSS you just include it via `@import 'path/to/your/third-party-styles.css'` at the top of the main.styl file.


## Webpack Hints

You can find the webpack configuration in the [webpack.config.js file](./webpack.config.js).
We use the babel-loader in order to load .jsx and .js files via webpack. If it's possible install all your dependencies with NPM. Packages installed with NPM can be used like this:

```language-javascript

var moduleXYZ = require('moduleXYZ');

```
You can find all loaders in this [list](http://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-loaders.html).
